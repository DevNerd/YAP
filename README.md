YAP - Yet Another Plugin
========================

Made by Erik Kooistra and Pieter Vlasblom on HITB2012AMS Hackweekday.
We won 1337 Dollar, and we are now going to continue development.

The plugin is a very very basic proof of concept to proof that we can compare sha1 hashes
based on a sha1 file.



TODO
====

> Add SSL

> Add Signing of Files

> Possible looking into headers for sha1 Hashes.

> More cool stuff?!
