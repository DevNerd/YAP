YAP - Yet Another Plugin
========================

Made by Erik Kooistra and Pieter Vlasblom on HITB2012AMS Hackweekday.
We won 1337 Dollar, and we are now going to continue development.

The plugin is a very very basic proof of concept to proof that we can compare sha1 hashes
based on a sha1 file.



TODO
====

> Add SSL Checks

> Add a basic API For developers to create systems to retrieve hashes!

FUTURE?
=======

in the future we want to be able to change the download location to a secure sandbox, and give the user the option to delete the file if the hashes
fail.

We want to be able to make sure our end-users are safe and secure!
